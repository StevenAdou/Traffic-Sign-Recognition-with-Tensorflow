# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-with-Tensorflow
python /tensorflow /matplotlib

This notebook is the first part of a tutorial to build a deep learning model for traffic sign recognition. The goal is to build a model that can detect and classify traffic signs in a video stream taken from a moving car.

First Objective: Traffic Sign Classification
I'll start with a simple goal: classifiction. Given an image of a traffic sign, our model should be able to tell it's type (e.g. Stop sign, speed limit, yield sign, ...etc.). We'll work with images that are properly cropped such that the traffic sign takes most of the image.

For this project, I'm using Pythong 3.5, Tensorflow 0.11, Numpy, Sci-kit Image, and Matplotlib. All pretty standard tools in machine learning.
